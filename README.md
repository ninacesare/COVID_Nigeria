Analysis of Nigeria Center for Disease Control COVID-19 data and National Demographic and Health Survey to assess determinants of COVID-19 deaths


We used three datasets to complete his analysis. Two datasets are from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (2018 NDHS) implemented by the National Population Commission (NPC) (9). The third is from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) COVID-19 daily reports (10). The 2018 NDHS provides data on national demographic and public health indicators. Results are published separately for male and female residents, as biometric data is collected for female participants alone. Participants range in age from 15 to 59 years. In total there are 41821 female and 13311 male participants with an average of 1490 participants per state. 

The state-level sociodemographic factors include: wealth index, insurance coverage, median age, and type of residence. The wealth index was defined by NDHS based on household ownership of consumer goods (including, television, cars) and housing characteristics (such as, flooring materials and toilet facilities) (9). We specifically focus on the percent of the population categorized by this index as ‘poorest’. Type of residence measures the percent of the population that lives within urban areas.  

The NCDC COVID-19 data includes daily reports of case counts, death counts and recovery counts for all 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FTC). The data used for this analysis was collected between February 27th, 2020, and July 25th, 2021.
